Timer{

Look up how to add a timer to the page. 

figure out where to add the timer ( will it be in an existing function or on it's own?)

Also, per instrusctions figuring out what needs to be moved in the html and css js requried  as well

figure out how to display the timer as game play is taking place. 

}

New Alert/Modal{
	Look up how to display a modal, 

	Once first step is figured out, consider where to place function. ( I'm assuming this will be placed at the end of the JS as it should be one of the last things that occur.)

	Seems as though a variable will have to be created that stores the total time played from the timer and it will be called upon/displayed in the modal

	Modal will appear when all cards have class of match?

	Figure out how to add a button that will restart the game{
		Will this be as simple as calling upon the deal function attached to an even listener ? 
	}

	Figure out how to add a close modal button{
		another event listener i presume? 
	}
